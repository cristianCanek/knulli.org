* If ad hoc networking will be used, also enable *Automatically Use Hotspot for Local Netplay* and, optionally, *Automatically Create Lobby*
  
# To host a netplay game:

* Long press east on a supported game in the gamelist and select Start a Netplay Game.
* Then select *Host a Netplay Game*.  The game will start and set up the netplay host.

# To join a netplay game:

* Run the same game (preferably same exact ROM).
* Press menu+south to enter the Retroarch Menu.
* Press south to go up one menu then move down to *Netplay*.

Further configuration parameters like ad hoc access point name and port can be found in batocera.conf.
